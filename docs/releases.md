# Releases

How versions are cut once automation is already configured. **Local signed build + GitHub Release + F-Droid Pages:** [Local release build and publish](#local-release-build-and-publish) below. **First-time GitHub Actions, permissions, and signing secrets:** [build-automation.md](build-automation.md).

Versioning is **SemVer**. The Gradle `versionName` and `versionCode` both come from [`version.txt`](../version.txt):

```
versionCode = MAJOR * 1_000_000 + MINOR * 1_000 + PATCH
```

Tags look like `v1.0.0` (`include-v-in-tag` in `release-please-config.json`).

## Conventional Commits

Merges to `master` **must** use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). CI rejects other subjects (and pull request titles). Install the local hook with `./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`. Details: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

| Prefix | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `feat:` | minor bump (pre-1.0 also uses minor for features; `bump-minor-pre-major` is on) |
| `fix:` | patch |
| `feat!:` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` | major |
| `chore:`, `docs:`, `ci:` | no version bump unless configured otherwise |

The release PR updates `version.txt`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `.release-please-manifest.json`. Merging it tags `vX.Y.Z` and creates the GitHub Release.

The **Release** workflow uses `GITHUB_TOKEN`. The repository must allow Actions to open PRs:

**Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions**
- Read and write permissions
- **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**

Without that checkbox, release-please can push `release-please--branches--master` but the job fails with *GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests*.

The APK pack still runs from that workflow when a release is created, and from tag pushes (`release-assets.yml` uploads with `--clobber`). Squash-merge the release PR if GitHub offers it; a merge commit also works as long as the PR was labeled `autorelease: pending`.

## CI

| Workflow | When | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) | PR and push to `master` | `testDebugUnitTest` |
| [`.github/workflows/conventional-commits.yml`](../.github/workflows/conventional-commits.yml) | PR (including title edits) and push to `master` | Conventional Commit subjects |
| [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml) | push to `master` | release-please; if a release was created, pack APK |
| [`.github/workflows/release-assets.yml`](../.github/workflows/release-assets.yml) | tag `v*.*.*`, workflow_call, or `workflow_dispatch` | test, signed `assembleRelease`, upload `burton-weather-<version>.apk` |

The tag must match `version.txt` (without the `v`). Checkout uses the tag ref. Duplicate uploads use `--clobber`.

SDK setup lives in [`.github/actions/setup-android-ci`](../.github/actions/setup-android-ci/action.yml): Temurin 17, Android SDK `platform-tools`, `local.properties` `sdk.dir`.

## Signing

Local and CI signing, including how `KEYSTORE_BASE64` maps to your JKS and the `gh secret set` commands, is documented in [build-automation.md](build-automation.md).

GitHub repository secrets used by [`.github/workflows/release-assets.yml`](../.github/workflows/release-assets.yml):

| Secret | Local source |
| --- | --- |
| `KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Base64 of the JKS named in `storeFile` |
| `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | `storePassword` |
| `KEY_ALIAS` | `keyAlias` (optional; default `burton`) |
| `KEY_PASSWORD` | `keyPassword` (optional; default store password) |

Never commit `keystore.properties` or the keystore.

## Local release build and publish

Do this from a `burton-weather` checkout. The version argument **must match** [`version.txt`](../version.txt) (today that is `1.0.0`). Both scripts accept `1.0.0` or `v1.0.0`.

Do **not** hand-edit `version.txt` to invent a new number. After a `feat:` / `fix:` on `master`, merge the release-please PR so `version.txt` and tag `vX.Y.Z` move together. The **Release-please** job only runs when `github.repository` is `Burton-Workspaces/burton-weather` (see [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml)), so forks do not open version PRs.

### One-time setup

Skip any step you have already done. To do the F-Droid working tree, Pages checkout, signing keystore, and GitHub Actions secrets in one pass:

```bash
./scripts/setup-fdroid-and-secrets.sh
```

That script is idempotent. It reuses `~/fdroid` and `../rabun-app-dist` when they already exist, copies a sibling Burton JKS if this repo has no keystore yet, creates `Burton-Workspaces/burton-weather` if needed, and writes `KEYSTORE_BASE64` / `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`. Manual steps below are the same work, split out.

**1. App signing** (same JKS CI uses; see [build-automation.md](build-automation.md))

```bash
cp keystore.properties.example keystore.properties
```

Point `storeFile` at your JKS and fill `storePassword`, `keyAlias`, and `keyPassword`.

**2. GitHub CLI** must be able to write this repo’s Releases:

```bash
gh auth status
```

**3. F-Droid index key** (private machine; not the Pages repo)

```bash
pipx install fdroidserver
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
which fdroid   # $HOME/.local/bin/fdroid — not Debian /usr/bin/fdroid
mkdir -p ~/fdroid && cd ~/fdroid
fdroid init
chmod 0600 config.yml
```

Debian `fdroidserver` 2.2.1 cannot scan this app (`androguard` / `res1 must be zero!`). Details: [fdroid.md](fdroid.md).

In `~/fdroid/config.yml` set `repo_url` to `https://burton-workspaces.github.io/burton-app-dist/fdroid/repo`. Details: [fdroid.md](fdroid.md).

**4. Pages checkout** — clone [Burton-Workspaces/burton-app-dist](https://github.com/Burton-Workspaces/burton-app-dist) **next to** this app (`../rabun-app-dist`). `./scripts/publish-fdroid-pages.sh` uses that path by default. The same catalog already hosts the other Burton Android apps.

### Each release

**5. Pack the tree that matches `version.txt`.** After a real bump, check out that tag (or build `master` once the release-please PR is merged). Gradle reads `versionName` from `version.txt` in the tree you assemble.

**6. Signed build and attach to this GitHub repo**

```bash
cd /path/to/burton-weather
./scripts/upload-release-apk.sh 1.0.0
```

That runs `assembleRelease`, copies `burton-weather-1.0.0.apk` into the repo root (gitignored), and uploads it to GitHub Release `v1.0.0` (`--clobber` if the asset already exists).

**7. Publish the same APK to the F-Droid Pages repo**

```bash
export FDROID_ROOT=~/fdroid
./scripts/publish-fdroid-pages.sh 1.0.0
```

That reuses `burton-weather-1.0.0.apk` if it is still in the app root, runs `fdroid update --create-metadata` (required in the shared catalog; plain `update` ignores a package with no YAML), copies only `repo/` into `../rabun-app-dist/fdroid/repo/`, writes `FINGERPRINT`, and pushes.

**8. First F-Droid publish only:** confirm `~/fdroid/metadata/com.burton.weather.yml` has name, license, and summary, then run step 7 again if that file was only a stub.

**9. Confirm**

- GitHub Release: `https://github.com/Burton-Workspaces/burton-weather/releases/tag/v1.0.0`
- F-Droid index: `https://burton-workspaces.github.io/burton-app-dist/fdroid/repo`
- Fingerprint: `../rabun-app-dist/FINGERPRINT` (also printed by the publish script)

Droidify → **Repositories** → **+**

- Address: `https://burton-workspaces.github.io/burton-app-dist/fdroid/repo`
- Fingerprint: the 64-character hex from `FINGERPRINT`

Replace `1.0.0` with whatever is in `version.txt` on later versions.

## Manual APK retry (CI)

GitHub Actions → **Release assets** → Run workflow → tag `vX.Y.Z` (must already exist and match `version.txt`). That only attaches the APK to the GitHub Release; it does not update the F-Droid Pages repo. For Pages, still run step 7.
