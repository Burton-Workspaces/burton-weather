# F-Droid / Droidify repository

GitHub Releases are APK downloads. [Droidify](https://github.com/Droid-ify/client) and the official F-Droid client do **not** subscribe to those. They need an **F-Droid repository**: a public HTTPS folder with signed APKs plus a signed catalog (`index-v1.jar`).

This is a **self-hosted simple binary repo** of the same APKs CI already signs. It is not submission to [f-droid.org](https://f-droid.org/), which rebuilds from source and signs with F-Droid’s key.

Official HOWTO: [Setup an F-Droid App Repo](https://f-droid.org/docs/Setup_an_F-Droid_App_Repo/).

Burton Android apps share one Pages catalog: [Burton-Workspaces/burton-app-dist](https://github.com/Burton-Workspaces/burton-app-dist). Publish this APK into that same `repo/` so Droidify users already subscribed keep seeing updates.

## Two keys

Do not mix these up.

| Key | File | What it signs | Used where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **App signing key** | `release.jks` (alias `burton`) | The APK | Android update verification. Same key as [build-automation.md](build-automation.md) / GitHub Releases. |
| **Repo signing key** | Created by `fdroid init` (`keystore.jks` in the fdroid working directory) | The repo index (`index-v1.jar`) | Droidify / F-Droid **Fingerprint** |

The Fingerprint is the **SHA-256 of the repo certificate**, 64 hex characters with no colons. Clients pin it so a fake catalog at the same URL cannot replace yours. It is **not** the APK keystore fingerprint.

Keep the repo keystore and `config.yml` private and backed up. Never publish `config.yml` (it contains passwords). Never commit either keystore to git.

Rotating the **repo** key means every user must re-add the repository. Rotating `release.jks` is worse: Android will refuse APK updates.

## Create the repo

Do this on a machine that is **not** the public web server (laptop is fine). If you already publish Burton Sonos / Meeting / Slack, reuse that `~/fdroid` working tree.

`./scripts/setup-fdroid-and-secrets.sh` installs `fdroidserver` if needed, reuses or creates `~/fdroid`, clones the Pages repo, and then writes this app’s GitHub signing secrets.

```bash
pipx install fdroidserver
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
which fdroid   # must be $HOME/.local/bin/fdroid, not /usr/bin/fdroid
mkdir -p ~/fdroid && cd ~/fdroid
fdroid init
chmod 0600 config.yml
```

Do **not** use Debian’s `apt install fdroidserver` (2.2.1). That stack’s Androguard cannot scan APKs from Android Gradle Plugin 8.7 (`res1 must be zero!` / `resources.arsc`). `./scripts/publish-fdroid-pages.sh` prepends `~/.local/bin` and refuses `/usr/bin/fdroid` for that reason.

Set `repo_url` to:

`https://burton-workspaces.github.io/burton-app-dist/fdroid/repo`

Clone [burton-app-dist](https://github.com/Burton-Workspaces/burton-app-dist) **next to** this app repo (`../rabun-app-dist`). Pages is served from `main` at `/`. The `/fdroid/repo` path is filled by the publish script.

## Publish with the Pages script

`scripts/publish-fdroid-pages.sh` copies a signed APK into your private `fdroid` working tree, runs `fdroid update`, then mirrors **only** `repo/` into [burton-app-dist](https://github.com/Burton-Workspaces/burton-app-dist) and pushes.

It will not use this Android repo as the Pages target, and it will not copy `config.yml` or the repo keystore. `FDROID_PAGES_DIR` defaults to `../rabun-app-dist` when that clone exists.

```bash
export FDROID_ROOT=~/fdroid
cp fdroid-pages.env.example fdroid-pages.env   # optional; source it if you want
./scripts/publish-fdroid-pages.sh 1.0.0
```

| Input | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `<version>` | Must match `version.txt` (`1.0.0` or `v1.0.0`) |
| `FDROID_ROOT` | Directory from `fdroid init` (private; holds `config.yml` and the repo keystore) |
| `FDROID_PAGES_DIR` | Git checkout of `burton-app-dist` (defaults to `../rabun-app-dist`) |
| `FDROID_ASSEMBLE=1` | Always run `assembleRelease` (default: assemble only if `burton-weather-<version>.apk` is missing) |
| `FDROID_PAGES_PUSH=0` | Commit in the Pages checkout but do not `git push` |

What it does, in order:

1. Checks the version against `version.txt`.
2. Uses `burton-weather-<version>.apk` in the app repo root if present (from `./scripts/upload-release-apk.sh` or an earlier assemble); otherwise runs `assembleRelease`.
3. Copies that APK into `$FDROID_ROOT/repo/`.
4. Runs `fdroid update --create-metadata` (always). Plain `fdroid update` ignores a new APK when the shared catalog already has YAML for other Burton apps. The script then fails if `com.burton.weather` is missing from `index.xml`.
5. `rsync`s `$FDROID_ROOT/repo/` → `$FDROID_PAGES_DIR/fdroid/repo/` (`--delete` so the hosted index matches). Touches `.nojekyll` so GitHub Pages does not process the tree as Jekyll.
6. Commits `Publish Burton Weather <version>` in the Pages repo and pushes unless `FDROID_PAGES_PUSH=0`.
7. Prints the repo SHA-256 **Fingerprint** and the `?fingerprint=` add-repo URL when it can.

Typical release sequence (full walkthrough: [releases.md](releases.md)):

```bash
./scripts/upload-release-apk.sh 1.0.0
FDROID_ROOT=~/fdroid ./scripts/publish-fdroid-pages.sh 1.0.0
```

Metadata lives in `$FDROID_ROOT/metadata/com.burton.weather.yml` (name, license, summary). The publish script always passes `--create-metadata` so a new package is indexed even when Sonos/Slack YAML already exist in the same `~/fdroid` tree. If that YAML is only a stub, edit it and run the script again.

Keep `chmod 0600` on `$FDROID_ROOT/config.yml`.

## Read the Fingerprint

The Pages script prints it after a successful `fdroid update`. You can also read it from the repo keystore:

```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore ~/fdroid/keystore.jks | grep SHA256
```

Strip colons and spaces. You should have 64 hex characters.

This value is stable until you rotate the **repo** key. Publish it next to the repo URL (README, website, QR). Do **not** put the `release.jks` SHA-256 in Droidify’s Fingerprint field.

## Host `repo/` over HTTPS

The Pages script already publishes **only** `repo/` (APKs, icons, `index-v1.jar`, `index.xml`). Do not upload `config.yml` or `keystore.jks`.

GitHub Pages for this org, after the script has run against a repo named `burton-app-dist`:

`https://burton-workspaces.github.io/burton-app-dist/fdroid/repo`

## Add the repo in Droidify or F-Droid

Droidify / F-Droid → **Repositories** → **+**:

- **Address:** `https://<host>/fdroid/repo`
- **Fingerprint:** the 64-character SHA-256 from above

One link (paste into the client, or open on the phone):

```
https://<host>/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=<64HEX>
```

## What not to do

- Do not treat GitHub Releases as an F-Droid repo.
- Do not put the app-signing (`release.jks`) fingerprint in the client’s Fingerprint field.
- Do not commit `keystore.jks`, `release.jks`, or `config.yml`.
- Do not expect f-droid.org inclusion from this setup; that is a separate, rebuild-from-source process.
